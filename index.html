		<p class="instructions">R2D2 needs your help delivering the plans for the Death Star safely to the Rebel Base. There's just one problem. YOU DON'T SPEAK DROID! R2 will help you make sense of his beeps and flashes. Copy the pattern of colors R2 says by clicking the colors in the correct order to learn his language. Master the language of droids and help R2 save the Galaxy from the WRATH OF THE DEATH STAR!</p>
		<p class="loseAlert hidden">Oh no! You must have whistled instead of beeped. Your Droid language learning is coming along, but it wasn't enough to save the Galaxy from the wrath of the death star. Press START to try again!</p>
